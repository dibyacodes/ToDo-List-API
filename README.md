# TODOX-DEV
### Is supposed to be free to use todo list project for developers and for students with absolutely zero clutter.

That's just a gimmick, it's a project where you can add tasks, remove tasks and edit tasks and this is just for my concept on JS. If you wanna use it, you may.

## I shall make this into an desktop app and publish it here in github itself.

### I will make this readme file more beautiful and more marketable if I make this into a good usable software, for now it's just a reposity of concepts.
